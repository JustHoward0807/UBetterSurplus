## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a dynamic and efficient Web Application developed using _React_, _JavaScript_, _C#_, _Entity Framework Core_, and _ASP.NET Core_. The application features a user interface crafted through _Figma_ and [_Fluent UI Design_](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/) principles.

### Why this website or Where the idea come from?
As an international student, we often need to buy cheap stuff such as furniture, monitor or a desk. [University of Utah Surplus Store](https://fbs.admin.utah.edu/surplus/) is typically the first place that comes to mind for such purchases.
However, the store relies on a PDF file to update customers about the current availability and timing of items. The way it displays the items is a HUGE pain; hence, I created this website to better showcase the items from that PDF file through data visualization and improved search filters.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**:
Implemented secure user authentication features using _JSON Web Tokens (JWT)_ and _BCrypt_ to ensure a robust and reliable authentication mechanism.

- **Real-time Inventory Data Extraction**:
Developed a data extraction mechanism that fetches real-time inventory information from the [University of Utah surplus store's frequently updated PDF file](https://fbs.admin.utah.edu/download/Surplus/listing.pdf). This eliminates the need for manual searches, enhancing user experience and efficiency.
The extracted data is stored in a _MySQL_ database, providing a structured and organized repository of inventory information.

- **Database Design and Optimization**:
Utilized _DBML (Database Markup Language)_ and _Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams_ to design and optimize the database structure.
Ensured data integrity and efficient data retrieval by implementing a well-thought-out database schema based on established design principles.
